            About

         <p class="emd-content">
            Established in 2014 as 7DOF Engineering, we began as a team of young engineers taking challenges to bring
            creative solutions to common civil and structural engineering problems. We started working with windbreak
            shelterbelts, billboards structures and residential development projects. The individual experiences of each
            member of the team enabled us to offer a range of services. Throughout the years, we successfully delivered
            and help build design projects from Commercial and Residential Developments, Hotels and Casinos, Warehouses
            and Industrial Structures, and a Museum. Furthermore, we also served as a structural engineering design
            contractor for a company in New Zealand.
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the past decade, the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries are already catching up with
            the advancements in technology for both hardware and software. This trend continues to serve us in
            navigating today’s business environment which also prompted us to start to invest in the development of new
            skills such as software development, in the last 5 years. We started by writing code for our internal
            workflows and functions by tapping into APIs, enabling us to become more efficient with what we do.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the start of 2021 and with the effects of the pandemic, we realigned our goals to expand upon our
            offered services in order to meet the demands of the industry and its increasing complexity. Hence, the
            change in our company name – E.M.D Civil & Structural Engineering Consultancy, to further bring us closer to
            the vision of our founder. We believe that the engineer of tomorrow will also be a capable software
            developer making his/her own tools to execute his/her traditionally expected functions. Therefore, we
            continually strive today to be at the forefront of this trend as we promise to deliver solutions outside of
            brick-and-mortar approaches in structural engineering.
